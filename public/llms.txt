# ced.ai — AI Consulting Firm

> ced.ai is an AI consulting firm that builds production-grade AI systems for businesses. Founded by Cedric Williams (UNC Chapel Hill CS/Econ, Georgia Tech MS HCI, Data Scientist since 2012).

## Core Identity

**Equation:** ced.ai = CompSci + CogSci + AI

Three disciplines, one methodology. Computer science for engineering rigor. Cognitive science for human-centered design. Artificial intelligence applied strategically where it reduces friction.

## 6-Step Methodology

Every engagement follows this framework:

1. **HCI / Wireframing** (Origin: Georgia Tech MS HCI) — Understand users before writing code. Observe actual workflows, interview stakeholders, map the real process.
2. **SpecKit / Specify** (Origin: Software Architecture) — Define every input, output, edge case, and failure mode before building.
3. **Pure Functions** (Origin: Computer Science) — Modular, testable, debuggable components. No side effects, no hidden state.
4. **Test-Driven Development** (Origin: Engineering Discipline) — Write tests before code. 406 tests on bid automation, 200+ on engagement tracker.
5. **Regression Testing** (Origin: Production Experience) — Catch drift before users do. AI systems degrade silently without it.
6. **CI/CD with AI Agents** (Origin: Modern AI Ops) — Automated quality gates, evaluation pipelines, continuous improvement.

## Three Pillars

### CompSci — Systems That Hold Up
Engineering rigor: pure functions, TDD, regression testing, CI/CD. The software backbone that makes AI systems debuggable, testable, and production-ready. A chain of pure functions means each stage is independently testable and replaceable.

### CogSci — Design for Humans
Human-centered design: trust surfaces, workflows, correction loops, adoption strategy. A trust surface is where a human decides to accept or override the AI's output. Every AI output should be traceable, overridable, and show its confidence level.

### AI — Leverage Where It Matters
Strategic AI application: extraction, classification, summarization with traceability, automation that knows when to refuse. LLMs for bounded tasks. ML pipelines for pattern recognition. AI agents for orchestration. A regex that works is better than an LLM that usually works.

## Case Studies

### SSA / Bid Manager (Construction x AI)
- **Problem:** 4-hour manual bid process, ~2 bids/day, scattered across email/Drive/Sheets
- **Solution:** AI email classification (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) + document analysis + knowledge graph
- **Results:** 90%+ time savings, >95% classification accuracy, 406 tests
- **Tech:** n8n, Python, FastAPI, React, Claude AI, OpenRouter, Google Workspace APIs, Firestore
- **Methodology:** All 6 steps applied
- **Key insight:** The documented workflow had 6 steps. The real workflow had 23.

### NCCA Zoom Tracker (Education x Analytics)
- **Problem:** Virtual school losing 25% of class time to camera policing. Zoom has no camera on/off API.
- **Solution:** Python library inferring camera status from QoS bitrate metrics (3-tier detection)
- **Results:** 25% instructional time reclaimed, 200+ tests, zero false positives, deterrent effect
- **Tech:** Python, Flask, Zoom API, SSE, Server-to-Server OAuth
- **Methodology:** Steps 1, 3, 4, 5
- **Key insight:** The problem wasn't "we need camera tracking." It was "I lose my first 15 minutes every class."

### Merces Watch App (Consumer x Mobile)
- **Problem:** No intelligent watch face discovery for Apple Watch
- **Solution:** AI camera color extraction + color theory matching + custom .mercesface format
- **Results:** 71 Swift files, MVVM architecture, offline-first, pre-launch
- **Tech:** Swift, SwiftUI, Firebase, AdMob, WatchConnectivity, ZIPFoundation
- **Methodology:** Steps 1, 2, 3
- **Key insight:** People choose watch faces by context ("goes with this outfit"), not by category.

## Key Concepts

**Trust Surface:** The point where a human decides to accept or override AI output. Designed explicitly with transparency, override capability, feedback loops, and confidence signals.

**Pure Function Pipeline:** AI architecture where each processing stage has no side effects. Input in, output out. Makes AI systems debuggable when things go wrong.

**Monday Morning Test:** Design principle that systems must work for tired, rushed, skeptical users — not just demo audiences. If it requires training, it's not simple enough.

**AI with Traceability:** Every AI output traces to source data and reasoning. Users see what the AI did and why. Essential for trust and meaningful human oversight.
