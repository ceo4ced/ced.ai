# ced.ai — AI Consulting Firm

> ced.ai is an AI consulting firm that builds production-grade AI systems for businesses. Founded by Cedric Williams (UNC Chapel Hill CS/Econ, Georgia Tech MS HCI, Data Scientist since 2012).

## What we do

ced.ai builds AI systems that solve real business problems using a 6-step methodology:
1. HCI / Wireframing — Understand users before writing code
2. SpecKit / Specify — Define precise specifications and edge cases
3. Pure Functions — Modular, testable, debuggable components
4. Test-Driven Development — Write tests before code
5. Regression Testing — Catch drift before users do
6. CI/CD with AI Agents — Intelligent deployment and monitoring

## Core equation

ced.ai = CompSci + CogSci + AI

Three disciplines, one methodology:
- **CompSci**: Engineering rigor — pure functions, TDD, regression testing
- **CogSci**: Human-centered design — trust surfaces, workflows, adoption
- **AI**: Strategic application — extraction, classification, automation with traceability
