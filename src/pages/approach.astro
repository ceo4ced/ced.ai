                    In 25 years of building systems, the pattern is always the same: technically brilliant solutions that nobody uses. The model accuracy doesn't matter if the workflow is broken. The automation doesn't help if people don't trust it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned this the hard way — building analytics dashboards that gathered dust, recommendation engines that users ignored, and classifiers that created more work than they saved. The technology was sound. The human design wasn't.

                <p>
                    This methodology didn't come from a textbook. It emerged from building systems that had to work — in construction offices, virtual classrooms, and mobile apps used by real people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The foundation is a dual degree in Economics and Computer Science with an AI/ML concentration from UNC Chapel Hill, followed by a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from Georgia Tech. The economics training shaped how we think about incentives and systems. The CS training gave us the engineering rigor. The HCI training taught us that neither matters without understanding the human in the loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 2012, the work has been Data Science — building models, pipelines, and intelligent systems across industries. Each project added a lesson. Each failure sharpened the methodology. The 6 steps above aren't theoretical. They're battle-tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, we've been on both sides. Building systems teaches you what's possible. Using systems teaches you what's needed. That dual perspective is what separates tools that ship from tools that stick.
