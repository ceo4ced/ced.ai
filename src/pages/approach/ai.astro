                    The AI hype cycle produces a predictable failure mode: organizations adopt AI because they feel they should, not because they've identified a specific problem where AI is the right solution. The result is AI systems that add complexity, cost, and unreliability to processes that worked fine before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've seen construction companies try to use GPT to replace estimators (it can't). We've seen schools try to use AI to replace teachers (it shouldn't). We've seen startups build LLM-powered features that could have been a database query.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AI pillar exists to apply intelligence where it actually creates leverage — and to have the discipline to say "this doesn't need AI" when that's the honest answer.

                <p>
                    AI is powerful when applied to specific, bounded tasks where the value of speed and scale outweighs the cost of occasional errors. These are the patterns we see across every industry:

                    <h3>Extraction</h3>
                    <p>Pulling structured data from unstructured sources. Emails, documents, images, conversations. The bid manager extracts project names, deadlines, scopes, and material lists from free-form RFI emails — work that took a human 30 minutes per email.</p>

                <div class="capability-card">
                    <h3>Classification</h3>
                    <p>Sorting inputs into categories at scale. >95% accuracy on email classification for the bid manager across hundreds of categories. The key is defining categories precisely and building evaluation pipelines that catch accuracy drift.</p>

                <div class="capability-card">
                    <h3>Summarization with traceability</h3>
                    <p>Condensing information while maintaining source links. When the document analyzer summarizes a 40-page bid package, every claim cites the exact page and paragraph. Users trust summaries they can verify.</p>

                    <p>Finding signals in noise. The Zoom tracker infers camera status from QoS bitrate patterns — a signal that exists in the data but isn't exposed by Zoom's API. AI detects what traditional logic can't express.</p>

                    <p>End-to-end process automation that knows when to stop and ask a human. The bid pipeline automates email → classification → extraction → filing, but flags low-confidence results for human review instead of guessing.</p>

    <!-- Traceability -->

            <h2 class="section-title">Every AI output should be traceable.</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Black-box AI is a liability. When a system produces an output and nobody can explain why, the system can't be trusted, debugged, or improved. Traceability isn't a feature — it's a design requirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our systems, every AI decision comes with provenance. The bid manager shows which email features triggered a classification. The document analyzer cites specific pages for every extracted data point. The knowledge graph tracks every source document for every node and relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn't just about user trust — though that matters enormously. Traceability is how you debug AI systems. When classification accuracy drops, traceable outputs let you identify exactly which input patterns are causing failures. Without traceability, you're guessing.

                    The AI pillar is built on an AI/ML concentration within the Computer Science degree from UNC Chapel Hill, plus over a decade as a Data Scientist. The academic foundation covers machine learning theory, statistical modeling, and algorithm design. The production experience covers everything the theory doesn't — data quality issues, model drift, evaluation at scale, and the gap between benchmark accuracy and real-world performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The progression matters: PC era → Data Science → Machine Learning → Modern AI. This isn't someone who discovered AI in 2023. It's someone who watched the field evolve from statistical models to neural networks to transformers to LLM agents — and who understands which techniques actually survive contact with production data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AI pillar is deliberately listed third, after CompSci and CogSci. Not because AI is least important — because it's most effective when it sits on a foundation of engineering rigor and human understanding. AI without CompSci breaks in production. AI without CogSci gets ignored by users. AI with both creates genuine leverage.
